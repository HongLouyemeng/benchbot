cuda-cudart-dev is important (i.e. dev version not normal):
  the dev version as libcudart_static.a which is used in the IsaacSim make process!

"cuda" symlink in /usr/local to "cuda-VERSION" needs to be manually done
  everyone has the symlink & seem to think they remember having to do it manually?

had to install cuda-10-1 (which installs both 4.18 & 4.30 drivers) for seg fault to go away
  seems weird & excessive.... but eh
